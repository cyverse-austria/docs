### Add User to Admin Group (LDAP)

Create an LDIF file named `add-de_admins.ldif` to add a user to the `de-admins` LDAP group. Replace `YOUR_USER_NAME` with the actual username of the user you want to add.

```ldif
dn: cn=de_admins,ou=Groups,dc=tugraz,dc=at
changetype: modify
add: memberuid
memberuid: YOUR_USER_NAME

read -s PASSWORD && export PASSWORD
ldapmodify -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=tugraz,dc=at" -w $PASSWORD -f add-de_admins.ldif
```
